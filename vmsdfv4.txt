1. Training was useful
2. DMR some challenges to understand GEE
3. They want to use their susceptibility but it is difficult for them to define the threshold 
4. They are interested to implement it in GEE, might need some technical help (Nishan mentioned that their is ADPC and SIG Team)
	Thomas also mentioned the trade-off of decising a particular threshold
5. They will work on AP model to define the threshold and then will be tuning lhasa v1
6. They were asking if local precipitation can be used?
7. There will be a comparison between AP model and LHASA v1
8. Then they can decide if they will focus on LHASA version 1
9. They become more familiar with LHASA version 1 and google earth engine
10. 



11. They will use GPM IMERG precipitation
12. Will change susceptibility maps
13. Will work on defining the threshold of susceptibility map from AP model
14. Option 1: they will buy their own server
	Option 2: Will stick to the earth engine app
	Option 3: ADPC wil host the app and they will use
